## The Setting


### World building, setting and story
- The World is something in which the Hero acts.
- World building/ settings is secondary to story.

- Do not insist of revealing ‘Hand of Artist’ (showing more emphasis on beauty of world).

- World building can lead to mono dimensional characters. 
- Avoid this. There is always diversity in life and people.

- World building is like alchemy. It is about creating enchantment. 
- Find pivot points between real and imaginary worlds. Take best of both.

- __The Framework of the World__
    - How do days and seasons work in your world??
    - Geography, Terrain?
    - Weather/Physical environment. Is it similiar to earth or has an alien environment?
    - The Senses of people or creatures?
    - Life is Random/Illogical? Things should not be too consistent.
  
- __The Culture of the World__
    - How do basic needs work in your world? Food, water. Shelter?
    - Language? Why? How does it feel like when one speaks?
    - Social structure
    - Politics
    - Commerce? Trade? How its done?
    - Media? Internet? Or anything to compare?
    - Leisure? Bars? How people relax?
    - Customs? 
    - Beliefs?
    - The Laws?
    - World History? What happened? Why are the things happening now?

- People have existing frameworks. Mashup. You can tap into that. 
- __Eg__: A tribal society on alien planet based on humans; GoT; Stranger Things.

- Be consistent in the setting. Don't contradict on what you told earlier in the story.

- __Real purpose of world building__
    - Get the audience to build the world in their imagination.
    - Reveal details in the manner like this: flashlight used in a dark room to look for things around.
    - Provide enough details in a scene that audience can extrapolate.
    - The best built worlds are un-obstructive. The don’t get in the way of story writing.
    - The world needs a Mystery inside it which you do not reveal. This engages audience.


### How to use Mazlow Hierarchy of Needs:
- Psychological and Basic needs are need for achieving Self actualisation.
- You can use this pyramid to create tension in story by removing one of the 4 basic needs.
- Characters can be stationed in any floor in pyramid and then its behaviour can be described.
- See personal development graph here. It can used to decide which details of characters to descrive first.


### Voice and Perspective:
- Outer Voice attributes:
    - Speech
    - Exclamations
    - Actions
    - Mask wore by characters.
    - Alter voice.

- Inner voice attributes:
    - Real feelings
    - Vulnerability, lack of self worth
    - Insecurity, wounds of the past.


### 30K feet to 0 and Back
- Closeup shots vs wide shots. 
- Grand overview vs intricate details. 
- Eg:(30000 feet altitude) Aerial shots, traffic shots.
- Use these carefully to describe a scene.


### Devil is in the details
- Describe the stuff as if you have been there/experienced it.
- Detail matters. Eg: The bushy moustache, Sword name, handle grip.
- Go overboard in details when writing first draft. Remove the extras in editing the draft.
- Allow details to speak.
