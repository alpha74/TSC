### Getting dialogue and action to work together

- Both serve to move your story forward.
- Avoid characters explaining for ought to be happening.
- Keep dialogue real. Wooden dialogue kills the story.

- Think: Do people really speak like that? People donâ€™t  speak in carefully crafted sentences.
- Think: Try to act when reading the lines of characters to check if it feels fake.
- Eg: Dialogue between gunfire is unrealistic.

- Make sure language used by characters matches its background. Try to distinguish characters by using this factor.

- Draw inspirations from actors who did that role in movies.

- Use weaving: Moving plot forward by inserting action amid dialogue. 
- Eg: Lords of Asylum.
