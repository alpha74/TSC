## Elements of Story


### Start a story: Dunk in
- Dunk the readers into it. The dunk must feel real.
- You have to put a seed here that will develop into the story. 
- Be in the middle of action, and tell backstory afterwards.
- Hook the reader right in the beginning.

- Dunk the reader, then step back from it.
- Reader has only once the blank slate and complete attention of you at the start.
- Don’t lose attention at start.


### What If approach
- Put the context of the story: What is the driving factor, when, who, what?
- This needs to be specific and not vague.
- It should start a quest in the reader to go deep or to read further.


### Finish a story:
- Sometimes you need to start at end.
- Think when this story will end. Think of meaning at end.
- This will help course the story from start to end.

- One has make a sacrifice for an ultimate ending.
- Or should have satisfying ending.

- Never fully close a story. Leave something unresolved for readers imagination.
- Research the emotion you need at the end.
- Write a prompt, eg: a line, poem.


### How to create characters
- Characters can be human or inanimate object.
- Not every characters needs an arc. Only give arcs to main characters.
- Give the appropriate motivation when non essential characters appears in the story.

- Imagine: every character has a different voice. Eg: thin voice, deep voice. Think like that when writing the dialogues.
- Nothing makes a character more alive than a flaw that can be observed.
- Know motivation of characters of why they are in the story.
